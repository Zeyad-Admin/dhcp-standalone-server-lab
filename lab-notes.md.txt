# 📘 Standalone DHCP Server Deployment
> 🧪 Hands-on lab demonstrating real-world Windows Server infrastructure skills

---

## 🏫 Course / Program
BCIT Technology Support Professional (TSP)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Deploy a dedicated DHCP server in an Active Directory domain environment, migrate DHCP services from the domain controller, and verify automatic IP assignment for domain clients.

---

## 🖥️ Environment

### Infrastructure

| Role | Hostname | OS | IP Address |
|------|-----------|----|------------|
| Domain Controller | DC-Z | Windows Server | 192.168.50.10 |
| DHCP Server | DHCP-Z | Windows Server | 192.168.50.20 |
| Client | CL-Z1 | Windows 11 | DHCP |

### Domain

Domain Name: corp.mog  
Network: 192.168.50.0/24  
Switch: LANZ-1 (Hyper-V Internal)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Windows Server
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DHCP Server Role
- DNS
- Hyper-V Virtualization
- Windows Client OS
- TCP/IP Networking

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Steps

1. Created virtual machines for DC-Z, DHCP-Z, and CL-Z1  
2. Configured static IP addresses for infrastructure servers  
3. Joined DHCP-Z to the corp.mog domain  
4. Installed the DHCP Server role on DHCP-Z  
5. Exported DHCP configuration from DC-Z  
6. Imported DHCP configuration to DHCP-Z  
7. Disabled DHCP service on DC-Z  
8. Authorized DHCP-Z in Active Directory  
9. Renewed client IP configuration to obtain address from DHCP-Z  
10. Verified connectivity and DNS resolution  

### DHCP Configuration Migration

The existing DHCP configuration was exported from the domain controller (DC-Z) using PowerShell and imported into the dedicated DHCP server (DHCP-Z).

This approach mirrors real-world infrastructure practices where DHCP services are migrated to standalone servers for scalability, security, and fault isolation.

## 📡 DHCP Scope Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Scope Range | 192.168.50.100 — 192.168.50.200 |
| Subnet Mask | 255.255.255.0 |
| Default Gateway | Not configured |
| DNS Server | 192.168.50.10 |
| DNS Domain | corp.mog |
| Exclusions | 192.168.50.101 — 192.168.50.110 |

### Scope Options Notes

DHCP scope options were configured to provide DNS services and domain information to clients.  
No default gateway was configured because the lab environment uses an isolated internal network without external routing.

---

## 🔐 Security / Best Practices Applied

- Dedicated DHCP server separated from the domain controller  
- DHCP authorization in Active Directory  
- Static IP configuration for critical servers  
- Controlled IP allocation range with exclusions  
- Internal-only virtual network isolation  

---

## 🧪 Verification / Testing

Commands used:

ipconfig /all
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
ping DC-Z
nslookup DC-Z


Result:

✔ Client successfully obtained IP from DHCP-Z  
✔ Domain connectivity verified  
✔ DNS name resolution functioning

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Importance of DHCP authorization in Active Directory environments  
- Benefits of separating infrastructure roles across servers  
- Troubleshooting network configuration issues in isolated environments  
- Interaction between DHCP, DNS, and Active Directory  

---

## 🚀 Real-World Application

This configuration reflects enterprise best practices where DHCP services are hosted on dedicated servers rather than domain controllers. This improves scalability, security, fault isolation, and maintainability in production networks.
